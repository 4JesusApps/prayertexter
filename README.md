# prayer-texter

This application is a work in progress!

Prayer Texter allows members to send in prayer requests to a specific phone number. Once a prayer request is received, it will get sent to multiple other members who have signed up to pray for others. Once someone has prayed for a prayer request that they have received, they will text back "prayed". This will alert the member who sent in the prayer request that their request has been prayed for.
